The addon adds two checkboxes to the display panel in 3d view properties.

Wireframe
- shows wireframe on all objects

Wireframe On Selected
- only show wireframe on selected objects

As this addons sets the wire settings for all objects its quite intrusive, and sometimes its desired to disable or force wire drawing on certain objects. This can be achieved by the "Override Wire Drawing" flag in object's display settings.
